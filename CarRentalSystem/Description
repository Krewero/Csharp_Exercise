You should create a Car class that has private fields 
for the make, model, rental price, and availability status (rented or not rented), 
as well as public methods for renting and returning a car, and printing information about a car.

Your program should also include a Main method 
that creates a collection of Car objects, and allows the user to rent and return cars, 
as well as view information about available cars.
